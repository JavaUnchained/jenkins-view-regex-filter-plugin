# regex-view-by-build-name 

The [original plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/view-job-filters-plugin) was used as a basis.

## About

This filter allows you to filter job by build name. Since in many companies, version stability is achieved by defining the version in build name. This plugin perfectly complements the [custom build monitor](https://github.com/JavaUnchained/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin)  and allows you to display the last specified version in the monitor instead of the latest build.
